# Typescript Bootcamp Course on Udemy

These are the code files and notes that I generated while taking a 
[Typescript Bootcamp Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=986406). Most of the files exist as demonstrations of fundamentals and should be used in conjunction with the notes files, though I have added simple comments in the `.ts` files where applicable. The notes files also contain some code examples when it was more expedient to describe them there.

The [notes](./notes/notes.md) can be found in `./notes`. `./notes/notes.md` is the main page with links out to the other notes pages.
